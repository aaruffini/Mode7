I followed the following youtube tutorial:

The creator's git hub is: StanislavPetrov

Their YT page is: Coder Space

I also took a look at the creator's git and copied some code for player movement and setup.

This program has inspired me to go two different routes:

1. I can repurpose this program to create 3d visualizers for live events/that sort of thing with the simple
movement code that was shown  n the second commit

2. I can repurpose this program and potentially use it for my long term goal of creating an FPS from scratch.
